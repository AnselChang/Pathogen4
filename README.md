About
===========
(Note: this software started development on March 27, 2023! It's in very early phases of development, so expect tons of bugs and missing functionality!)

Pathogen is the definitive visual auton maker for VEX and beyond.

Through a combination of node-based path design and blockly-style sequence of commands, this software aims to support any game, programming language, robot, and codebase.
